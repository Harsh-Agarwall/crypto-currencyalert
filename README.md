# Crypto Price Alert System

A cryptocurrency price alert system that allows users to set price thresholds for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other cryptocurrencies. When the price reaches the specified threshold, the system sends an email notification.

## Features
- Fetches real-time cryptocurrency prices using the [CoinGecko API](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).
- Users can set alerts for price conditions (greater than or less than a threshold).
- Redis caching is used to optimize API requests.
- Automated email notifications using **Nodemailer**.
- Backend hosted on **Render**, Redis service integrated.
- Frontend built with **React.js**.
